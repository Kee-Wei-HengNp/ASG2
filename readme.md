###### design rationale :speech_balloon:
This website is designed for people that are interested in getting fit, achieve their goals. This is conducted with the objective of creating a **free** informative space where only useful and **neccessary information**is present, to provide people  with a better **understanding** as to how they can **get in shape** . This would help users understand how important it is to simply be **healthy and live a balanced lifestyle.**


###### design process :+1: :thumbsup:
With our rationale in mind. The website would contain a short quiz in which users are able to either make or log in to their accounts to find out what body type they have to optimize their fitness journey by recommending exercise plans that best suit each user. A secondary benefit to the account system is the ability to look at the progress one has made from the start of their journey( helps users stay motivated also assists in future training plan-making).
